{% include _talk.html img="assets/img/tangles.jpeg" img_alt="Photograph of some green and yellow rope on a table, arranged in a tangle" speaker="Reading Group" title="Conway's Rational Tangles" date="Monday 21st February 2022" time="4.00-5pm GMT" description="We will be discussing the topic of John Conway's Rational Tangles, inspired by a Math Circle activity described by Tom Davis. Participants should aim to have read through [Tom's writeup of the activity](assets/papers/Conway's Rational Tangles - Tom Davis.pdf), and discussion can focus on either the topic itself or ways to run activities on it, depending on the preferences of the group.
  
The paper can also be found in [this folder](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/jlv2oz2dfm0a9sv/AACL4a7sz8f2QdQo7OuBTeLUa?dl=0) along with some more advanced papers for those who wish to read further, although this is not required in order to attend." %}

{% include _talk.html img="assets/img/roulette.jpeg" img_alt="Photograph of a roulette wheel" speaker="Adam Atkinson" title="Maths and Self-Defence" date="Monday 21st March 2022" time="9.30-10.15am GMT" description="When I was at school some of my teachers (in both maths and physics) used to set us exercises where we were shown arguments which were not necessarily correct and had to identify problems in them. This is how I first encountered the flawed Martingale gambling strategy. I will talk about another gambling myth with some international spread that seems less well known, partly as an excuse to talk about Markov Chains. Maths can be useful to defend oneself from charlatans!

Adam runs games and puzzles tables at open days: He used to be known as *Pisa University Fraud Department* but in recent years *L'Omino dei Giochi* (Little Games Guy) is what people have been calling him and he can live with that." %}
