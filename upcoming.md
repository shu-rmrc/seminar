    title="Conway's Rational Tangles"
    date="TBC"
    description="We will be discussing the topic of John Conway's Rational Tangles, inspired by a Math Circle activity described by Tom Davis. Participants should aim to have read through [Tom's writeup of the activity](assets/papers/Conway's Rational Tangles - Tom Davis.pdf), and discussion can focus on either the topic itself or ways to run activities on it, depending on the preferences of those who attend.

The paper can also be found in [this folder](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/jlv2oz2dfm0a9sv/AACL4a7sz8f2QdQo7OuBTeLUa?dl=0) along with some more advanced papers for those who wish to read further, although this is not required in order to attend."
