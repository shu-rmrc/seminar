Notes for Chairing a SHU-RMRC Seminar

Introduction
- Thank people for coming
- Explain what the group is (an overlap of maths, education, communications and history interests, which runs online seminars every now and then)
- Anyone here should be on the mailing list (but join if not, by visiting http://jiscmail.com/SHU-RMRC)
  - It is our policy that anyone who's in the Zoom call or sees the recording is someone we have contact details for, for safeguarding reasons
  - If you think someone else would like to join or see the recordings, the mailing list is where to send them - don't share the link to the recording!
- We're always looking for volunteers to give a talk or suggestions for people we could approach, and also for papers for reading group

-This talk is to be recorded; the recording will only show the main speaker and chair, and having a few people with cameras on will help the speaker, but if you don't want to accidentally pop up on the recording, please keep your camera and mic off.
- We have a code of conduct for our events (in summary: be friendly, don't share things from this session, including screenshots or content, online or elsewhere without explicit permission)
  - Link to COC: http://bit.ly/shurmrc-coc
If you have any questions, please puut them in the chat. _____ will be monitoring the chat, and can be DMd if you'd like to ask a question anonymously. If your question is urgent or a clarification, we'll interrupt the speaker, and if not we'll ask at the end.
- Welcome the speaker (details on website/in email)

At end of talk:
