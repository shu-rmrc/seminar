We aim to host talks on recent research (formal and informal) into mathematical aspects of recreational mathematics as well as its link to education, mathematics communication and history of mathematics. Recent talks have included the discovery of a new kind of non-standard dice numbering, the use of puzzles and games in undergraduate mathematics, application of number theory to a medieval board game and the use of language in writing puzzles.

The research cluster is a world-wide group of people interested in these topics. To join the research cluster please subscribe to the SHU Recreational Mathematics Research Cluster mailing list.

## Upcoming seminars

Subscribe to the SHU Recreational Mathematics Research Cluster mailing list to access seminars and past recordings. We will send details to join each online seminar to the mailing list near the the time. There is no cost to attend.

    title="Knotty knits: an exploration of math and crafts"
    date="Tuesday 9th November 2021"
    time="4.00-4.45pm GMT"
    description="Dr Sabetta Matsumoto from Georgia Institute of Technology will be discussing creative crafts and math research. What can physics learn from crochet? How does a simple stitch change the stretch of a scarf, and how are modern materials and manufacturing learning from their wooly ancestors? Join Dr Matsumoto for a talk about curvature using pattern making, symmetries using quilt squares and flags, hyperbolic space using quilting at crochet, and knot theory and coding using knits.

Dr Sabetta Matsumoto is an Assistant Professor in the School of Physics at the Georgia Institute of Technology. She is passionate about using textiles, 3D printing, and virtual reality to teach geometry and topology to the public."
