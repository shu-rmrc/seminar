We aim to host talks on recent research (formal and informal) into mathematical aspects of recreational mathematics as well as its link to education, mathematics communication and history of mathematics. Recent talks have included the discovery of a new kind of non-standard dice numbering, the use of puzzles and games in undergraduate mathematics, application of number theory to a medieval board game and the use of language in writing puzzles.

The research cluster is a world-wide group of people interested in these topics. To join the research cluster please subscribe to the [SHU Recreational Mathematics Research Cluster mailing list](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jiscmail.ac.uk%2FSHU-RMRC&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNENE6mx8ZdEZVSckovetPHsqedVoA).
